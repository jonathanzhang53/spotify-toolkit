# spotify-toolkit

I like to organize my Spotify, and I want to make sure I am allocating each song to one of my categorized playlists. This inspired me to create this script to detect duplicate songs across my playlists.

If my API keys are still exposed here, please no exploit I put in gitignore later.

Maybe in future I want to see more Spotify things so I add more functionality.

Nice.
