# spotify-toolkit

I like to organize my Spotify, and I want to make sure I am allocating each song to one of my categorized playlists. This inspired me to create this script to detect duplicate songs across my playlists.

Maybe in future I want to see more Spotify things so I add more functionality.

Nice.

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

`python p1.py`

`python p2.py`
